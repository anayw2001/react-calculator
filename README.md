This React calculator was built with simplicity in mind and implements the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Division
- Multiplication
- Exponentiation
- Square Root
- N-th Root
- Factorial

The calculator was designed so that it would be easy to add new operations. There are two classes of operations defined, single-operator (square root and factorial), and double-operator (everything else). 

The single-operator functions are meant to be used right after a number is inputted into the display.
For example: ```9```+```âˆšx``` or ```6```+```!```.

The double-operator functions are meant to be used as they would be with a normal calculator (i.e. ```6+8```).
